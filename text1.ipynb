      "  A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33] For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[36]\n",
      "  In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\n",

They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[45]\n",
      " There are many kinds of classifiers in use.[99] It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023.[114] Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO).\n",

It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda.[203] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[207] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\n",
      "  The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[210] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[211] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[216] If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.[218] These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware.[237] This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\".[251] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\n",
      "  The essential parts of civilization are not physical. While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors. In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[314] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\".[315] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself. He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[342] Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks. However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. Another definition has been adopted by Google,[349] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[360] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\n",
      "  This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\n",
      "  David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[364] While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[375] This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001:\n",
